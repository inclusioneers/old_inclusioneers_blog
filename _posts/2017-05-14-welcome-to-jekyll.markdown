# Inclusioneers
Engineering Inclusive Facilities, Events and Projects for Individuals of ALL Abilities in Summit County

## An “Inclusion-Friendly” Community
Picture a place where people of all abilities could enjoy public facilities, events and activities with their families and feel welcome.  Imagine a neighborhood that provides inclusive housing opportunities. Envision a community that treats everyone with respect and dignity and values each person’s unique contribution. One that employs people with disabilities and structures recreational activities so all can participate. An integral community dedicated to supporting academic and social success in schools and empowering people with all abilities to pursue their dreams.

### What do we have to gain?
Typically, many individuals with disabilities face difficulties, isolation and exclusion when outside of their immediate support group and environment. However, in an Inclusion- Friendly community where all abilities are valued and welcomed, everyone gains. Family and friends can readily see and feel the benefits of giving support to their loved ones with varying abilities. Employers who embrace diversity say placing individuals with disabilities alongside other team members helps to foster creativity and innovation throughout their organization. Libraries, parks, and museums that accommodate people with varying abilities, consistently report a pleasant experience for all participants. Everyone benefits where the community embraces a culture of inclusion.

## The Meaning of “Inclusion-Friendly”
For some, being in an Inclusion-Friendly environment means they will have a manageable degree of adaptations, that help them better engage their environment, broaden their social interactions and improve their social support. Inclusion-Friendly places embrace the concept of diversity, in that differences are recognized and respected as any other human variation. Studies show that diversity enriches all aspects of a community’s life, including education, housing, cultural harmony and business opportunities. These inclusive aspects of a community’s life enhance economic strength, because we all win when everyone gets to share in our nation’s promises.

## Who We Are
Inclusioneers is a partnership of volunteer engineers, formed to assist Summit County businesses, organizations and public agencies in the creation of an Inclusion-Friendly community. Together, Inclusioneers are volunteers that provide inclusive engineered solutions to help the disenfranchised enjoy the same facilities, events, and activities, that are commonly taken for granted by the mainstream population. Through volunteer time and talent, our team helps people of all abilities engage in community programs and enjoy their natural learning environment.

## Our Purpose
The Inclusioneers organization is formed exclusively for charitable purposes. The Inclusioneers organization is purposed for the charitable mission to provide inclusive engineered solutions that (a) are ADA (American Disabilities Act) compliant, (b) are designed by mentor engineers that volunteer from local businesses and student engineers that volunteer from local colleges, (c) bring accessibility to public facilities, public events and (d) provide independence and mobility to individuals with developmental disabilities, empowering people of all abilities in the Summit County community.

## Our Background
In the fall of 2015, it all started with a simple idea to bring an engineered solution to the aid of a 3 year old girl who just wanted to ride a bike with her siblings. Because she was born with a physical disability, she received support from a local board service agency, designed to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities. Through community connections between Summit DD Board, a local business engineer and the University of Akron, a volunteer effort was formed to grant a little girl’s wish.

In the spring of 2016, after the successful completion of an adaptive bike handle-bar project, additional requests for inclusive engineered solutions were met with enthusiasm. An entire class of 30 Biomedical Engineering (BME) students at the University of Akron (UA) volunteered to solve more client requests and make a positive “real world” impact on individual lives. With this expanded pool of talent, teams scaled up to accept 5 new projects. Additionally, mentor engineers from local businesses volunteered their time, project management experience and engineering know-how to assist the UA student engineers. As a result, projects moved more quickly and teams learned to clearly define: (a) Roles and Responsibilities, (b) Communication Channels, (c) Project Procedures and (d) model a classic Project Management approach throughout the project process (i.e. Concept Reviews, Design Reviews, and Design Testing etc.).

### Inclusioneers Projects in 2016
- Prosthetic Leg Attachment - A young girl had her left foot amputated at 15 months and had received several prosthetic legs over her life, that just never seemed to fit quite right for a growing and active child. The team carefully designed a prosthetic leg with a unique adjustable fit that would “grow” with her. Shortly after receiving her new prosthetic, the young girl ran in downtown Akron’s 1k Fun Run at Lock 3. For their efforts, the University of Akron Biomedical Engineering Design Team was awarded the Community Impact Award , by Summit DD Board.

- Adaptive Bike - A young boy could not ride a standard bike due to his physical disability. Bike modifications included: (a) a custom 3-D Printed Pedal designed and balanced to accommodate his shoe brace, (b) adjustable horizontal and vertical back/seat supports, (c) modified handbrakes to account for unequal hand strength and (d) engineered pedaling motion to prevent his leg joint from “locking up”.

- Combination Wheelchair - A young child’s family has two children that use wheelchairs and neither child can operate a wheelchair independently. The family requested a “combination” wheelchair designed so that one parent alone could easily mobilize both children while out of the house for shopping, visiting the park, traveling etc.

- Motorized Jeep - A young boy who uses a wheelchair for mobility wanted to enjoy playtime activities with his siblings. So, a donated Power Wheel was modified with a custom car seat that can be controlled locally by a child using a proximity switch or remotely by the parents with a modified Xbox controller.

- Tandem Wheelchair - A family with one child in a wheelchair and the other child in a stroller requested a “tandem” wheelchair design. The family requested a modified wheelchair designed so that one parent alone could easily mobilize both children while traveling out in the community.

### Inclusioneers in Greater Akron
Based on attendee suggestions at the 2016 Lock 3 Winterfest event (supported by the City of Akron Parks & Recreation and Summit DD), the Inclusioneers Steering Committee sought the resources to design an accessible slide (Reindeer Run). When the University of Akron was approached for student resources, they provided the assistance of 60 Civil Engineering students, to solve a “bigger idea”. The “bigger idea” formed the foundation to transform the Akron Parks & Recreation property at Lock 3 in downtown Akron into a community centerpiece for inclusion.  The Lock 3 Inclusion HUB project is a 3 year plan that includes: (a) a relocated Playground (donated by Summit DD), (b) an accessible Slide and Boardwalk, (c) Grass Seating designed into the slope of the terrain for viewing stage events, (d) a Bike Rental/Café building and (e) a Splash Pad.  The UA students’ final design and budget proposals for the Lock 3 Inclusion HUB project were completed in May, 2017.

### Project Schedule (2017 through 2019)
- 2017, Phase I Budget - Relocated Playground

- 2018, Phase II Budget - Accessible Slide, Boardwalk Grass Seating

- 2019, Phase III Budget - Splash Pad and Bike Rental/Café
