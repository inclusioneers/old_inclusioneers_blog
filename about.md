## Who We Are
Inclusioneers is a partnership of volunteer engineers, formed to assist Summit County businesses, organizations and public agencies in the creation of an Inclusion-Friendly community. Together, Inclusioneers are volunteers that provide inclusive engineered solutions to help the disenfranchised enjoy the same facilities, events, and activities, that are commonly taken for granted by the mainstream population. Through volunteer time and talent, our team helps people of all abilities engage in community programs and enjoy their natural learning environment.

## Our Purpose
The Inclusioneers organization is formed exclusively for charitable purposes. The Inclusioneers organization is purposed for the charitable mission to provide inclusive engineered solutions that (a) are ADA (American Disabilities Act) compliant, (b) are designed by mentor engineers that volunteer from local businesses and student engineers that volunteer from local colleges, (c) bring accessibility to public facilities, public events and (d) provide independence and mobility to individuals with developmental disabilities, empowering people of all abilities in the Summit County community.

## Our Background
In the fall of 2015, it all started with a simple idea to bring an engineered solution to the aid of a 3 year old girl who just wanted to ride a bike with her siblings. Because she was born with a physical disability, she received support from a local board service agency, designed to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities. Through community connections between Summit DD Board, a local business engineer and the University of Akron, a volunteer effort was formed to grant a little girl’s wish.

In the spring of 2016, after the successful completion of an adaptive bike handle-bar project, additional requests for inclusive engineered solutions were met with enthusiasm. An entire class of 30 Biomedical Engineering (BME) students at the University of Akron (UA) volunteered to solve more client requests and make a positive “real world” impact on individual lives. With this expanded pool of talent, teams scaled up to accept 5 new projects. Additionally, mentor engineers from local businesses volunteered their time, project management experience and engineering know-how to assist the UA student engineers. As a result, projects moved more quickly and teams learned to clearly define: (a) Roles and Responsibilities, (b) Communication Channels, (c) Project Procedures and (d) model a classic Project Management approach throughout the project process (i.e. Concept Reviews, Design Reviews, and Design Testing etc.).
